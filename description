Abstract: The project aims to develop a robust NLP-based classifier to accurately identify 
whether an essay was written by a human or generated by an AI. Utilizing advanced NLP 
techniques and models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and LSTM, we will examine the text 
features that distinguish human written content from machine-generated content. This 
research intends to enhance the detection of AI-generated text, thus supporting academic 
integrity. Additionally, computational efficiency will be evaluated to ensure practical 
application. 
Assumptions: 
      a) The dataset is representative of typical human and AI-generated essays. 
      b) Text features extracted from the dataset will be sufficient to differentiate between human   
and AI authorship. 
     c) Models trained on this dataset will generalize well to other unseen texts. 
Scope of the Project: 
a) Preprocessing the text data (tokenization, normalization, etc.) 
b) Feature extraction (syntax, semantics, stylometric features) 
c) Employing and comparing various classification models (BERT, RoBERTa, LSTM) 
d) Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
score 
e) Ensuring models are computationally efficient for real-world application 
f) Providing insights and recommendations for detecting AI-generated content in 
educational contexts
